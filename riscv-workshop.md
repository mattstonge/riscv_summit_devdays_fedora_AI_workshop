# Getting Started with RISC-V, Fedora, and AI
A hands-on workshop

[BACK to HOMEPAGE](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/README.md)



## Overview

In this exercise, we will install a new operating system by installing a microSD card that has been previously flashed with an aapropriate image for this hardware based upon Fedora 42 for RISC-V.

## Materials

Your workspace will contain either a DC ROMA II laptop or desktop (both leverage the same motherboard), a freshly flashed microSD card with Fedora 42, along with torx bit screwdriver and a smudger.


## DEMO One:

In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through flashing the microSD card with the latest image for Fedora 42/DC Roma II.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Two:  
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II laptop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Three: (optional)
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II desktop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## EXERCISE One:
Since we have flashed the microSD cards in advance (for time saving measures), we'll jump straight into installation of the microSD card into your laptop (or desktop).
> Please Note: If at any time during the exercise, you have difficulty or a question - please raise your hand.


## Steps:



### 1. Ensure power OFF
> Power should already be off but if on shutdown the machine either via command line or the Graphical Desktop.

### 2. Unplug power supply
> Disconnect the USB-C powersupply cable

### 3. Remove all modules from both sides
> While pressing the button between the slots, gently slide the modules outward.

### 4. Unscrew bottom section from the keyboard
> On the bottom of the laptop there are 5 screws. unscrew them with the torx bit.
> Please Note: The screws will NOT come all the way out - this is by design so they do not get lost. 

### 5. Flip laptop over (open faced)
> Gently flip the laptop over and carefullt open it's screen, laying it flat and open on the table.

### 6. Use smudger to gently pry up keyboard
> Please Note: You must use extreme caution during this step as it is easy to break the ribbon cable from the keyboard that is attached to the mainboard.
> Use the smudger to gently pry up the keyboard which is also magnetically attached. Do not jsut rip it up and off but only raise it a few inches. Just high enough to gently disconnect it from the mainboard. Once you have disconnected the keyboard from the mainboard set it aside.

### 7. DIsconnect battery with smudger

### 8. Use smudger to gently lift the metal bracket holding the microSD card

### 9. Remove microSD card (if present)

### 10. Install new Fedora 42 microSD card

### 11. Gently close/secure bracket

### 12. Reconnect battery

### 13. Replace keyboard

### 14. Close & flip laptop over

### 15. Gently tighten screws

### 16. Replace the modules back to their slots

### 17. Plug-in power supply

### 18. TURN ON THE POWER
