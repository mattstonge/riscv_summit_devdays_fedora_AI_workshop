# Getting Started with RISC-V, Fedora, and AI
A hands-on workshop

[BACK to HOMEPAGE](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/README.md)



## Overview

In this exercise, we will install a new operating system by installing a microSD card that has been previously flashed with an aapropriate image for this hardware based upon Fedora 42 for RISC-V.

## Materials

Your workspace will contain either a DC ROMA II laptop or desktop (both leverage the same motherboard), a freshly flashed microSD card with Fedora 42, along with torx bit screwdriver and a smudger.


## DEMO One:

In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through flashing the microSD card with the latest image for Fedora 42/DC Roma II.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Two:  
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II laptop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Three: (optional)
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II desktop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## EXERCISE One:
Since we have flashed the microSD cards in advance (for time saving measures), we'll jump straight into installation of the microSD card into your laptop (or desktop).
> Please Note: If at any time during the exercise, you have difficulty or a question - please raise your hand.
