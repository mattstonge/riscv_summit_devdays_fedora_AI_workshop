# Getting Started with RISC-V, Fedora, and AI
A hands-on workshop

[BACK to HOMEPAGE](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/README.md)



## Overview

In this exercise, we will install a new operating system by installing a microSD card that has been previously flashed with an aapropriate image for this hardware based upon Fedora 42 for RISC-V.

## Materials

Your workspace will contain either a DC ROMA II laptop or desktop (both leverage the same motherboard), a freshly flashed microSD card with Fedora 42, along with torx bit screwdriver and a smudger.

## DEMO One:

In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through flashing the microSD card with the latest image for Fedora 42/DC Roma II.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Two:  
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II laptop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## DEMO Three: (optional)
In this demo, Matt will walk everyone through the steps required to install the new microSD card into the DC Roma II desktop.
> Please Note:  You can also follow along the demo with the slide deck.

## EXERCISE One (A):
Since we have flashed the microSD cards in advance (for time saving measures), we'll jump straight into installation of the microSD card into your laptop. 
> For Desktop Users - go to EXERCISE One (B): 

> Please Note: If at any time during the exercise, you have difficulty or a question - please raise your hand.


## Steps:



### 1. Ensure power OFF
> Power should already be off but if on shutdown the machine either via command line or the Graphical Desktop.
![Power supply, all cords disconnected - POWER is OFF](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-power-off.jpg)


### 2. Unplug power supply
> Disconnect the USB-C powersupply cable

### 3. Remove all modules from both sides
> While pressing the button between the slots, gently slide the modules outward.
![Remove Modules](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-release-modules.jpg)


### 4. Unscrew bottom section from the keyboard
> On the bottom of the laptop there are 5 screws. unscrew them with the torx bit.
> Please Note: The screws will NOT come all the way out - this is by design so they do not get lost. 
![Unsecure 5 screws](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-unsecure-screws.jpg)


### 5. Flip laptop over (open faced)
> Gently flip the laptop over and carefullt open it's screen, laying it flat and open on the table.
![Open flat](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-open-flat.jpg)


### 6. Use smudger to gently pry up keyboard
> Please Note: You must use extreme caution during this step as it is easy to break the ribbon cable from the keyboard that is attached to the mainboard.
> Use the smudger to gently pry up the keyboard which is also magnetically attached. Do not just rip it up and off but only raise it a few inches. 
![Open Lid](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-open-lid.jpg)
> Just lift the keyboard high enough to gently disconnect it from the mainboard. Once you have disconnected the keyboard from the mainboard set it aside.
![Open Lid](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-disconnect-ribbon.jpg)


### 7. Disconnect battery with smudger
> Using the smudger, gently pry the battery connector off.
![Disconnect battery](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-disconnect-battery.jpg)
> Ensure the battery connector is gently disconnected
![Battery disconnected](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-batt-disconnected.jpg)

### 8. Use smudger to gently lift the metal bracket holding the microSD card
> Please Note: The card bracket is very fragile. It is on a hinge and should not be totally removed. 
> USE EXTREME CAUTION
> Gentry use the smudger to unlock the card bracket (it will swing upwards but not come off).

### 9. Remove microSD card (if present)
> If there was a microSD card in the slot, please set it aside.
![Replace card](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-remove-replace-card.jpg)


### 10. Install new Fedora 42 microSD card
> Place the Fedora 42 microSD card in the slot.

### 11. Gently close/secure bracket
> Gently close the bracket and secure the microSD card.
![Close latch](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-close-latch.jpg)


### 12. Reconnect battery
> Gently reattach the battery connector.
![Reconnect battery](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-reconnect-battery.jpg)


### 13. Reconnect and replace keyboard
> Carefully, realign the ribbon cable connector and reconnect it. 
![Align connector](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-reconnect-kb1.jpg)
![Insert connector](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-reconnect-kb2.jpg)
> Carefully, realign the keyboard in its place.
![Realign keyboard](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-replace-kb.jpg)


### 14. Close & flip laptop over
> Carefully close the laptop lid and then flip the laptop over laying it flat on the table (screws visible)

### 15. Gently tighten screws
> Gently secure the screws - do not over-tighten them as it can destroy the threading.
![Secure the 5 screws](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-secure-screws.jpg)


### 16. Replace the modules back to their slots
> Replace all modules back into the slots they were originally in.
![Replace modules](https://github.com/mattstonge/riscv_summit_devdays_fedora_AI_workshop/blob/main/images/lab1-replace-modules.gif)


### 17. Plug-in power supply
> Plug the USB-C power cord back into a USB-C slot.

### 18. TURN ON THE POWER
> Open the laptop up and gently press the power button.
> This is the end of this exercise - do not log into the machine yet.

Since we have flashed 1TB NVMe drives in advance (for time saving measures), we'll jump straight into installation of the microSD card into your desktop.

> Please Note: If at any time during the exercise, you have difficulty or a question - please raise your hand.
